TO-DO-LIST
Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:
1.	The HTML code defines the structure of the web page, including the header, body, and different sections of the To-Do List.
2.	The CSS code styles the elements of the To-Do List, including the colors, fonts, and layout.
3.	The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the To-Do List, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing completed tasks.
4.	The code is a simple HTML document with some CSS and JavaScript. It creates a basic HTML document with a heading, meta information, and a link to the fonts used.
5.	The code starts by defining the title of the page as "To do List" and then links to two external stylesheets, one for fonts and another for icons.
6.	The body of the page contains an unordered list that is used to display tasks on this list.
7.	Each task has a number assigned to it so that they can be easily sorted in order from most important to least important. Each item in the list is wrapped in tags which are followed by text inside tags. This text represents what needs to be done or completed on each particular task, such as "buy milk".
8.	This is the container for all of the buttons that are going to be on this page.
9.	It has an ul element inside it, which contains three list elements: "list_work", "list_sport", and "list_music".

The first list element in the ul is called "list_work" and its contents are two links: one link that says “finish action” and another link that says “0”.The second list element in the ul is called "list_sport" and its contents are two links: one link that says “finish action” and another link that says “1”.The third list element in the ul is called "list_music" and its contents are two links: one link that says “finish action” and another link that says “2”.
11.	The code is a part of the "cont_todo_list_top" container.
12.	It is used to create a button that takes you to the bottom of the list.The code starts with a section, which includes the title and links to the stylesheet and icon files.
•	The body of the document contains two paragraphs.The first paragraph has three heading tags. These are used to create different levels of headings in a document.
•	The text between these tags is divided into four blocks, each of which contains one line of code.The first block sets up some basic HTML elements, including the title and links to the style sheet and icon files.The second block defines three heading tags for use in later paragraphs.The third block defines a list item using the tag.
